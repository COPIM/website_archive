# COPIM's HugoSandbox

Here we should add more documentation. At the moment let's just add two useful links:
- [PREVIEW WEB SITE](https://b.copim.ac.uk/_preview/)
- [PUBLISHED WEB SITE](https://b.copim.ac.uk/)


If anything went wrong those two files could help few people not scared of reading logs :)

- https://b.copim.ac.uk/last-commit-log.txt
- https://b.copim.ac.uk/_preview/last-commit-log.txt

**Edit pages**
In WebSite/HugoSandbox there is a folder /content, which has the two menu folders (about us/home and work packages). All the individual pages are available there.

Alternatively use the link above to preview website to edit 

Use the little pen on the right to start editing a page.

Leave the info between ---- title and ----

Once you are done editing, under commit changes, where it says 'update...' type !publish! and then press the green commit changes button. Your changes will then be saved and will show up on the published website

**New Page**

Upload a new file in the about us or work package folders or use the top menu in the preview website to add a new page. You can change the order in the menu by changing the 'weight' as set in the title info in the document.

**Images**

Upload a new image file to static/images and publish it the same way as you would publish a page. When you want to insert an image in a page use the image icon in the toolbar and then insert the image file path, i.e.: ![](/images/All_COPIM_logos.png)
