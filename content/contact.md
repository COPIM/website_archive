You can follow our progress on our [PubPub](https://copim.pubpub.org/) site (which functions as a blog and open documentation site for the project) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/COPIMproject). If you have skills, knowledge or resources you’d like to offer, or if you would like to support the project and partnership in any other way, please get in touch:

For Work Package specific queries it might be useful to contact the relevant WP leader in the first instance – see the [People](https://b.copim.ac.uk/about-us/people/) page for details.
