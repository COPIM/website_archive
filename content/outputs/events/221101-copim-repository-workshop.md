#### Participating stakeholders:

_external_: Members of UKCORR.   

_internal_: Loughborough University; British Library; Jisc; Open Book Publishers; Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC).

#### Date & time:

Tuesday, November 01, 2022 @ 11am BST.

#### Overview:

COPIM (Community-Led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Monographs) is a 3.5-year project funded by Research England and Arcadia, that will develop and build the critical underlying modular components to support the sustainable publication of open access (OA) books, including infrastructures, business models, governance procedures, re-use strategies, preservation structures, and outreach programs. These systems and infrastructures will be open and collectively managed for the common good. Towards this end, COPIM aims to develop a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly in humanities and social sciences publishing.

COPIM is creating the **Thoth Archiving Network** to help scholar-led OA presses ensure that their works are archived. We want to demonstrate our work so far in creating automated processes to minimise the time and resource needed from the presses to ensure this essential element of work.

#### Workshop aims:

The workshop plans to outline our current work in archiving open access books and demonstrate the work we have done so far working with Thoth and Open Book Publishers. In addition, we want to ask UKCORR members if they would be willing to join the Thoth Archiving Network and, if not, what potential barriers exist in members not joining.
