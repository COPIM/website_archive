#### Participating stakeholders:

_internal_: punctum books.



#### Overview:

COPIM (Community-Led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Monographs) is a 3.5-year project funded by Research England and Arcadia, that will develop and build the critical underlying modular components to support the sustainable publication of open access (OA) books, including infrastructures, business models, governance procedures, re-use strategies, preservation structures, and outreach programs. These systems and infrastructures will be open and collectively managed for the common good. Towards this end, COPIM aims to develop a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly in humanities and social sciences publishing. Project aims:

COPIM is creating the **[Open Book Collective](https://copim.pubpub.org/open-book-collective)** (OBC), an open, community-led community and platform for libraries and other supporters to support OA presses and service providers - a structure which we are developing together with the community of stakeholders (academics, publishers, librarians, researchers, and knowledge managers) that will be involved in and will be supporting and relying on the infrastructures, workflows and systems that COPIM is creating for open access monographs. We want to emphasize horizontalist and cooperative knowledge-sharing endeavours between communities of professional-public academic practice.

### Workshop aims:

From the outset of its development, the Open Book Collective (OBC) has engaged in discussions with OA stakeholders seeking opinions from librarians regarding consortial library funding for open-access books and building an organization and platform. During 2020, the OBC published its findings in several publications about the EU perspective including the Southern European perspective; the Scandinavian perspective; the German perspective; and the Polish perspective. As the OBC finalizes its organization and platform, WP2 members return to EU librarians and library consortia as part of a larger series of workshops to receive further feedback about the the state of OBC before its official launch.
