The infrastructure used by open access publishers must be driven by, and responsive to, the varied needs of an international scholarly community.  
A key aspect of COPIM is therefore that it privileges close working relationships between publishers, librarians, infrastructure providers, and other members of the scholarly community.

COPIM is an international partnership comprising

-   **universities:** Coventry University, Birkbeck, University of
    London, Lancaster University and Trinity College, University of
    Cambridge;

-   established **scholar-led open access presses**, represented through
    the ScholarLed consortium, which consists of Open Book Publishers,
    punctum books, Open Humanities Press, Mattering Press, and meson
    press;

-   **libraries:** UCSB Library, Loughborough University Library, the
    British Library;

-   **infrastructure providers**: the Directory of Open Access Books
    (DOAB), Jisc ;

-   and **membership organisations:** the Digital Preservation
    Coalition.
