The infrastructure used by open access publishers must be driven by, and responsive to, the varied needs of an international scholarly community.  
A key aspect of COPIM is therefore that it privileges close working relationships between publishers, librarians, infrastructure providers, and other members of the scholarly community.

COPIM is an international partnership comprising

-   **universities:** [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/current-projects/2020/copim/) , [Birkbeck, University of London](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/news/birkbeck-to-play-leading-role-in-project-to-transform-open-access-academic-publishing), [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/lancaster-university-part-of-28m-project-to-increase-access-to-valuable-research), and [Trinity College, University of Cambridge](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/);

-   established **scholar-led open access presses**, represented through
    the [ScholarLed consortium](https://scholarled.org/), which consists of [Open Book Publishers](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/),
    [punctum books](https://punctumbooks.com/), [Open Humanities Press](https://openhumanitiespress.org/), [Mattering Press](https://www.matteringpress.org/), and [meson press](https://meson.press/);

### Collaborations

Thanks to funding from [OPERAS-P](https://operas.hypotheses.org/operas-p), a European Coordinator for Open Access Book Publishing works jointly between OPERAS-P and COPIM, based at Open Book Publishers. The European Coordinator is working to facilitate exchange between the various library and scholarly publishing communities within the EU and the COPIM project.
