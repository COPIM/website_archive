**Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs*** (COPIM) transforms Open Access (OA) book publishing by delivering major improvements in the infrastructures used by OA book publishers and those publishers making a transition to OA books. COPIMâ€™s innovations will enable more productive collaborations between stakeholders (including librarians, publishers, and researchers) in the OA landscape and expand opportunities to develop the skills necessary to run OA publishing operations.

COPIM is a strategic international partnership led by Coventry University consisting of world-class universities (Birkbeck University, Lancaster University and Trinity College, Cambridge), established scholar-led open access (OA) presses (represented through the ScholarLed consortium, which consists of Open Book Publishers, punctum books, Open Humanities Press, Mattering Press, and meson press), libraries (UCSB Library, Loughborough University Library) and infrastructure providers (DOAB, Jisc Collections).
