The project consolidates existing relationships among the partners into a major strategic collaboration that will enhance the impact of research internationally. At the same time, COPIM promotes a community-based approach for the collaboration of academic institutions and industry stakeholders. Finally, it develops innovative approaches for knowledge exchange activities to facilitate sustainable and workable transitions to an open publication ecosystem for monographs and to ensure a diverse ecology of publishers.

COPIM will benefit the general public and the economy by maximising the dissemination and impact of world-leading research. The adoption of COPIMâ€™s infrastructures, business models, preservation structures, and governance procedures, will enable economic sustainability and enhanced capacities, at smaller and larger scales, for open access books. It will offer Higher Education institutions and Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences researchers sustainable publishing models they control, increased publishing options, and cost-reductions to build a more horizontal and co-operative knowledge sharing community.
