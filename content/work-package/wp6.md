# Experimental Publishing, Re-use, and Impact

### Lead

* Janneke Adema (Coventry University) 

> WP6 examines ways to more closely align existing software, technologies, workflows and infrastructures for experimental publishing with the workflow of OA book publishers and with the infrastructures that COPIM will create. It will produce a set of pilot cases of experimental books (including by ScholarLed presses Open Humanities Press and Mattering Press) which will be developed with the aid of these new tools and integrated into COPIMâ€™s infrastructure. Relationships will be established with open source publishing platforms and projects focused on experimental long-form publications and outreach activities will be conducted with OA book publishers and authors to further promote experimental publishing opportunities. WP6 will also explore how non-experimental OA books are (re)used by the scholarly community. As such, it will examine those technologies and cultural strategies that are most effective in promoting OA book content interaction and reuse. This includes building communities around content and collections via annotations, comments and post-publication review (e.g. hypothes.is) to enable more collaborative forms of knowledge production. To achieve this, WP6 will map both existing technological solutions as well as cultural barriers and best practices with respect to reuse.

### Key deliverables and impacts 

* A pilot of representative experimental books built on top and integrated within the COPIM infrastructure; 
* An online resource detailing opportunities for experimental book publishing; 
* Technologies and cultural strategies to promote OA book content discovery, interaction and reuse and the creation, development and interaction with emergent genres of scholarship; 
* Reuse and engagement strategy for OA book publishers and scholars
