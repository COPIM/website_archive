> WP6 examines ways to more closely align existing software, technologies, workflows and infrastructures for experimental publishing with the workflow of open access book publishers and with the infrastructures that COPIM is working to create. It is producing a set of pilot cases of experimental books (including by ScholarLed presses Open Humanities Press and Mattering Press) which are developed with the aid of these new tools and integrated into COPIM’s infrastructure. Relationships have been established with open source publishing platforms and projects focused on experimental long-form publications, amongst others as part of an Experimental Publishing workshop facilitated by Coventry University in July 2019. Further outreach activities will be conducted with open access book publishers and authors to further promote experimental publishing opportunities. WP6 also explores how non-experimental open access books are (re)used by the scholarly community. As such, it is examining those technologies and cultural strategies that are most effective in promoting open access book content interaction and reuse. This includes building communities around content and collections via annotations, comments and post-publication review (e.g. hypothes.is) to enable more collaborative forms of knowledge production. To achieve this, WP6 is mapping both existing technological solutions as well as cultural barriers and best practices with respect to reuse.  

### Key deliverables and impacts

* A pilot of representative experimental books built on top and integrated within the COPIM infrastructure;
* An online resource detailing opportunities for experimental book publishing;
* Technologies and cultural strategies to promote open access book content discovery, interaction and reuse and the creation, development and interaction with emergent genres of scholarship;
* Reuse and engagement strategy for open access book publishers and scholars
