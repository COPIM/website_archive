WP1 coordinates activities across the COPIM project, fosters exchange across Work Packages, manages public dissemination and outreach activities, and maintains technical infrastructure for project management and communication.

Internally, WP1 ensures that the overall project meets its objectives within budget and scheduled timescales by monitoring project progress, tracking deliverables, and reporting back to the funders. Together with all partners involved, it organizes biannual project meetings, publishes reports on project progress and provides the communications infrastructure for all Work Packages.

    Infrastructure
  </summary>

In accordance with the project's overall aims of enabling openness in book publishing, COPIM's project infrastructure is built on open-source software. We lead by example in managing our project using entirely open systems and by maintaining those systems ourselves wherever possible.

Where the project is developing new software such as [Thoth](https://thoth.pub/), this software is also licensed with open-source licenses and made publicly available to facilitate community improvements and experimentation.
