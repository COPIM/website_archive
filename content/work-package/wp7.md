> WP7 will identify the key challenges associated with archiving research monographs in all their variation and complexity and develop new solutions. The concept of a monograph as “just” text with the odd image or table is increasingly outdated. “Books” now come in multiple digital formats (e.g. pdf, xml, epub) as well as hardcopy, and can also include embedded material such as videos and interactive 3D models. In some publications, users can interact directly with content hosted externally, such as databases and URLs. As individual objects, each of these formats—such as a pdf file or a video—appear in established guidance and standards for preservation and can be reliably archived with time, effort and resource. Yet how does one archive a “book” which consists of all of these? Technical methods for effectively archiving complex digital research publications and for creating an integrated collection of content in different formats have not yet been developed. In addition, legal issues further complicate effective archiving, even when the technical aspects have been resolved—these complications are potentially compounded when content collections are to be archived. Archiving solutions should also be relatively inexpensive, to ensure it can be adopted broadly by less well-financed presses.  


### Blog posts & project output

* See COPIM's **[Open Documentation Site: WP7](https://copim.pubpub.org/work-package-7)** for an overview of blog posts, announcements, etc.  
* in addition to that, visit our **[Outputs](https://www.copim.ac.uk/about-us/outputs/) section** for deliverables and milestones reached by the Work Package.  


### Key deliverables and impacts  

* Technical methods for effectively archiving complex digital research publications and for creating an integrated collection of content in different formats  
* Pilot case archiving a subset of ScholarLed publications in at least two different locations (Loughborough, UCSB, BL)  
* A model which enables the expansion and uptake of the methods by other presses and libraries
* Recommendations for best practice around legal and copyright issues that complicate effective archiving of complex digital research publications
