> WP4 is developing the governance procedures of COPIM’s open publication ecosystem for monographs. It is creating durable organisational structures for the coordination, governance and administrative support of the project’s community-owned infrastructure. This includes developing new avenues of outreach, communication and partnership with diverse stakeholders in open research with a shared interest in this infrastructure, creating genuine community involvement and collective control (ensuring the infrastructures won’t be governed by a particular commercial interest), amongst others in the form of a Community Governance Workshop, facilitated by UCSB Library in May 2020. WP4 is conducting research on collectively managed infrastructures as well as the technical governance between stakeholders (including libraries). In collaboration with WP2/3, it has assembled a publisher-librarian working group on Humanities Commons for: (a) the long-term management of consortial library funding programs, and (b) the identification and fostering of library-publisher experiments and projects that emphasise horizontal and cooperative knowledge-sharing between stakeholders (librarians, publishers, and researchers). WP4 is also conducting research on best practices for governing collaborative community-based book publishing projects of various scales, in line with professed needs of new and upstart publishers.
