> WP4 will develop the governance procedures of COPIM’s open publication ecosystem for monographs. It will create durable organisational structures for the coordination, governance an administrative support of the project’s community-owned infrastructure. This includes developing new avenues of outreach, communication and partnership with diverse stakeholders in open research with a shared interest in this infrastructure, creating genuine community involvement and collective control (ensuring the infrastructures won’t be governed by a particular commercial interest). WP4 will conduct research on collectively managed infrastructures as well as the technical governance between stakeholders (including libraries). In collaboration with WP2/3, it will assemble a publisher-librarian working group for: (a) the long-term management of consortial library funding programs, and (b) the identification and fostering of library-publisher experiments and projects that emphasise horizontal and cooperative knowledge-sharing between stakeholders (librarians, publishers, and researchers). WP4 will also conduct research on best practices for governing collaborative community-based book publishing projects of various scales, in line with professed needs of new and upstart publishers.
