You can follow our progress on our [PubPub](https://copim.pubpub.org/) site, which functions as the project’s blog and open documentation site, and on COPIM’s Twitter account.

If you have skills, knowledge or resources you’d like to offer, or if you would like to support the project and partnership in any other way, please get in touch via [info@copim.ac.uk](mailto:info@copim.ac.uk)

For Work Package-specific queries it might be useful to contact the relevant WP in the first instance – see the respective [Work Package](https://www.copim.ac.uk/work-package/) pages for further details.
