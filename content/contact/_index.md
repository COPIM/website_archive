You can follow our progress on our [PubPub](https://copim.pubpub.org/) site, which functions as a blog and open documentation site for the project, and on COPIM's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/COPIMproject) account. If you have skills, knowledge or resources you’d like to offer, or if you would like to support the project and partnership in any other way, please get in touch via [info@copim.ac.uk](mailto:info@copim.ac.uk)

For Work Package-specific queries it might be useful to contact the relevant WP leader in the first instance – see our [People](/about-us/people/) page for further details.
