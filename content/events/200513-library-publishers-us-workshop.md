#### A COPIM community-workshop in collaboration with University of Michigan, Lyrasis, and ScholarLed

**How can libraries and publishers shape the future of Open Access books**

COPIM (Community-Led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Monographs) is a 3-year project funded by Research England and Arcadia, that will develop and build the critical underlying modular components to support the sustainable publication of open access (OA) books, including infrastructures, business models, governance procedures, re-use strategies, preservation structures, and outreach programs. These systems and infrastructures will be open and collectively managed for the common good. Towards this end, COPIM aims to develop a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly in humanities and social sciences publishing.

**Project aims:** COPIM intends to set up an open, community-led and controlled platform for libraries and presses to support one another, a structure which we want to develop together with the community of stakeholders (academics, publishers, librarians, researchers, and knowledge managers) that will be involved in and will be supporting and relying on the infrastructures, workflows and systems that COPIM will create for open access monographs. We want to emphasize horizontalist and cooperative knowledge-sharing endeavours between communities of professional-public academic practice.

We want to use this opportunity to tackle the big questions about library support for Open Access books. Given that libraries do not need to purchase copies when a book is available OA, how might libraries contribute to their funding? What are the current mechanisms for funding OA books, and what are their advantages and drawbacks? What else could we imagine and how might it work? How can we ensure that any new system is sustainable, and what would its community governance look like?

**Workshop aims:** The outcome of this workshop will be the establishment of a working group for (a) the long-term development of a consortial library funding platform, and (b) the identification and fostering of library-publisher experiments and projects that emphasise horizontal and cooperative knowledge-sharing between stakeholders (e.g. librarians, publishers, and researchers).

The workshop is organized around the following three themes:

1. What do libraries want to achieve by supporting Open Access books/infrastructures? What types of initiatives do libraries wish to support?
  * How do libraries decide who to support?
  * What information do they need to select/renew support?
  * Who makes selection decisions? (individual libraries, third parties, â€¦?)
2. What financial models might best support the integration of Open Access books into libraries? What types of financial/administrative infrastructures are required?
  * Are intermediaries needed between libraries and publishing initiatives?
  * Single intermediary or multiple intermediaries? New or existing?
3. What governance structures and practices are required to ensure the sustainability of these efforts? Different infrastructure for financial flows and information?
  * What types of governance structures are required?
  * How to developing and sustain trust amongst both libraries and publishers?
  * How to represent the diversity of libraries types and differing library objectives? How to incorporate geographic diversity?
