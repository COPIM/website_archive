##### A COPIM community-workshop in collaboration with University of California, Santa Barbara Library, ScholarLed, and Coventry University

üîçüñ∫ **Documentation available here: [COPIM Community Governance Workshop Recap: Part 1](https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.6a3a2ca2)**

**Short overview**

COPIM (Community-Led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Monographs) is a 3-year project funded by Research England and Arcadia, that will develop and build the critical underlying modular components to support the sustainable publication of open access (OA) books, including infrastructures, business models, governance procedures, re-use strategies, preservation structures, and outreach programs. These systems and infrastructures will be open and collectively managed for the common good. Towards this, end COPIM aims to develop a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly in humanities and social sciences publishing.

**Aims:**

COPIM intends to set up an open, community-led and controlled governance structure, a structure which we want to develop together with the community of stakeholders (academics, publishers, librarians, researchers, and knowledge managers) that will be involved in and will be supporting and relying on the infrastructures, workflows and systems that COPIM will create for open access monographs. We want to emphasize horizontalist and cooperative knowledge-sharing endeavours between communities of professional-public academic practice. The aims of the working group are to help:

* Determine the values and ethos that should underlie COPIM‚Äòs governance procedures. How can we enable equitable, horizontal relationships in scholarly communication? How can we formalize COPIM‚Äôs governance structure to guarantee accountability to the consortium‚Äôs (future) members (both presses and libraries)?
* Determine best practices (and what not to do) for community governance.
* Determine the kind of durable organizational structures for the coordination, governance an administrative support of the project‚Äôs community-owned infrastructure.
* Develop official policies and procedures for self-governance and administrative management of the infrastructure.
* Determine best practices for governing collaborative community-based book publishing projects of various scales, in line with professed needs of new and upstart publishers.
* Establish a working group to continue development of COPIM‚Äôs governance structure, creating genuine community involvement and collective control, while ensuring the infrastructures won‚Äôt be governed by a particular commercial interest.

The outcome of this workshop will be the establishment of a working group for
* (a) the long-term management of consortial library funding programs, and
* (b) the identification and fostering of library-publisher experiments and projects that emphasise horizontal and cooperative knowledge-sharing between stakeholders (e.g. librarians, publishers, and researchers).
This working group will identify and/or form the beginning of a governance community of representative stakeholders for the COPIM project.

**Schedule:**

All times BST

_14.55-15.15_: Participants dial-in and sound test ‚Äì confirm attendance.
Short introduction by organisers

_15:15-15:20_: Welcome from UCSB Library

_15.20_: Introduction to the project:
	 * Janneke Adema introduces the COPIM project (brief overview of work packages and the overall aims of the project)
   * Sam Moore introduces WP4 and outputs, the basic conception of governance, the aims of the workshop and how we expect it to develop (advisory board, Humanities Commons group etc.)

_15.40_: Participant introductions: participants to introduce themselves, their research and/or their projects, including how their interests relate to governance of scholarly communication.  

_16.00_: 10-15-minute break (a virtual coffee room will be available in Zoom if you want to keep chatting)

_16.15_: First question for break-out discussion, to be discussed in groups of 4-5: What does good governance mean to you? Participants to describe their experience of governance ‚Äì either as researchers or with respect to the projects they lead. What do we need to consider when designing systems of governance? What processes did you use to decide the governance structures for your project?

In advance of this, we would ask participants to read the Next Generation Library Publishing Project‚Äôs [recent report](https://educopia.org/principles_values_wp/) and our recently [released blogpost](https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.20a5c646) to get a sense for some of the issues we will be discussing.

_16.20_: Discussion time (three groups): 30 minutes plus 20-minute break

_17.00_: Report back to the group on discussions (10 mins per group). The moderators will report back to the group on the discussions, offering a chance for wider discussions and any concrete recommendations or issues the group feel we need to follow up on.

_17.30_: Next questions: Who is COPIM‚Äôs community? How can we identify and nurture this community? Participants to discuss the meaning of community and how it relates to the COPIM project. What issues are there around defining a community? Is ‚Äòstakeholders‚Äô a better term?

_18.15_: Report back to the group on discussions.

_18.45_: Future steps ‚Äì How would we like to keep in touch? Participants will be asked to confirm that they are willing to be part of the working group and to suggest other projects we might want to work and share info with.
