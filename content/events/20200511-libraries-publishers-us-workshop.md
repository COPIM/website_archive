**How can libraries and publishers shape the future of Open Access books**

The workshop is organized around the following three themes:

1. What do libraries want to achieve by supporting Open Access books/infrastructures?

2. What financial models might best support the integration of Open Access books into libraries?

3. What governance structures and practices are required to ensure the sustainability of these efforts?
