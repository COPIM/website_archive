As part of its activities, WP3 will convene a range of publisher stakeholders at a workshop to demonstrate the new infrastructural provisions and to locate at least two non-OA publishers willing to partially transition their business models to a new OA version.</description>

      <description>Building an Open Dissemination System Lead  Rupert Gatti (Trinity College, Cambridge)   WP5 will develop technical protocols and infrastructure to better integrate OA books into institutional library, digital learning and repository systems.

      <description>Archiving and Digital Preservation Leads  Gareth Cole (Loughborough University Library) Rupert Gatti (Trinity College)   WP7 will identify the key challenges associated with archiving research monographs in all their variation and complexity and develop new solutions. The concept of a monograph as “just” text with the odd image or table is increasingly outdated. “Books” now come in multiple digital formats (e.g. pdf, xml, epub) as well as hardcopy, and can also include embedded material such as videos and interactive 3D models.</description>
